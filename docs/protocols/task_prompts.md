# MBT Cache Protocol Prompts

These prompts are reusable task starters. They do not override `AGENTS.md` or
the protocols.

## Research Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, docs/invariants/core_invariants.md,
docs/protocols/lifecycle_protocol.md, and
docs/protocols/research_protocol.md first.

Task: prepare a research brief for [slug].

Do not write code. Do not change dependencies. Produce
docs/reviews/[slug]/[slug]_research_brief.md with measured object, source
materials, evidence table, hypotheses, unknowns, risks, required decisions
before spec, and recommended next phase.
```

## Spec Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, core_invariants.md, lifecycle_protocol.md,
research_protocol.md, spec_protocol.md, peer_audit_protocol.md, the research
brief, and relevant code.

Task: write docs/specs/[slug]_SPEC.md.

Do not write code. The spec must bind source schema, cache schema, Heed
payload storage, SQLite key-only lookup, latest/range routes,
search/time-machine routes, MBT I/O and trusted access, codegen, crate
boundaries, dependencies, determinism, failure behavior, correctness oracle,
benchmarks, compile-surface budget, runtime budget, code paths, generated
artifacts, tests, review paths, and approval checklist.
```

## Peer Audit Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, core_invariants.md, lifecycle_protocol.md,
spec_protocol.md, peer_audit_protocol.md, the research brief, and the target
spec.

Task: audit docs/specs/[slug]_SPEC.md.

Do not edit the spec in the first pass. Try to falsify measured object clarity,
schema ownership, Heed payload semantics, SQLite lookup semantics, route
boundaries, MBT access safety, codegen determinism, crate isolation,
compile-surface budget, dependency containment, correctness oracle, benchmark
isolation, failure behavior, and code binding completeness. Write
docs/reviews/[slug]/[slug]_peer_audit.md and classify exactly
PEER_AUDIT_PASSED or BLOCKED.
```

## Implementation Plan Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, core_invariants.md, lifecycle_protocol.md,
implementation_protocol.md, code_style_protocol.md, testing_benchmark_protocol.md,
the approved spec, and the peer audit.

Task: write docs/reviews/[slug]/[slug]_implementation_plan.md.

Do not write code. Bind every file to edit/create, generated artifact,
dependency change, test, benchmark, evidence path, command, expected output,
risk, and validation step. End with an explicit approval gate before code.
```

## Implementation Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, implementation_protocol.md, code_style_protocol.md,
codegen_protocol.md when relevant, testing_benchmark_protocol.md, the approved
spec, and the approved implementation plan.

Task: implement only the approved plan.

Do not add behavior absent from the spec. Keep changes minimal. After code,
perform the pre-test audit required by implementation_protocol.md and report
whether testing may begin.
```

## Test and Benchmark Prompt

```text
Read AGENTS.md, testing_benchmark_protocol.md, the approved spec, approved
implementation plan, and implemented code paths.

Task: run the bound tests and benchmarks.

Do not change expected values, tolerances, or benchmark scope unless
independent evidence proves the original expectation was wrong. Record command,
machine metadata, schema identity, Heed/SQLite identity when relevant, dataset
identity, correctness, determinism, compile-surface output when relevant,
benchmark output, and limitations. Prepare the result review.
```
