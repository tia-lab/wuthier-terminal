# PROTOCOL: MBT Cache Code Style

Version: 1.0
Status: active
Scope: Rust and support code

## Purpose

Define the minimum code discipline for MBT Cache production and evidence code.

## Required Reads

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/invariants/core_invariants.md`
- approved spec
- approved implementation plan
- `docs/protocols/implementation_protocol.md`
- `docs/protocols/testing_benchmark_protocol.md`

## Rules

1. Validation first.
2. Deterministic ordering.
3. Panic-free runtime, codegen, persistence, and measurement logic.
4. Explicit error handling.
5. Explicit copy and allocation boundaries.
6. No hidden defaults.
7. No unbound configuration.
8. No inline benchmark claims.
9. No implementation behavior absent from spec.
10. Small modules and explicit types.
11. No public API by accident.
12. No benchmark code in production libraries.
13. No serde payload path in runtime adapters.
14. No old monolithic MBT dependency.
15. No MBT payload bytes in SQLite.
16. No latest/range SQLite route.

## Rust Shape

Preferred order inside non-trivial files:

1. imports,
2. constants,
3. config types,
4. error/result types,
5. public entrypoints,
6. validation helpers,
7. runtime, persistence, or codegen core,
8. artifact/report helpers,
9. tests only if the approved plan permits colocated unit tests.

`lib.rs` files should export modules and public items only. Move non-trivial
logic into named modules such as `runtime.rs`, `payload.rs`, `lookup.rs`,
`schema.rs`, `predicate.rs`, or `adapter_emit.rs`.

## Error Handling

Runtime, persistence, codegen, and measurement logic must not use:

- `unwrap`,
- `expect`,
- `panic!`,
- `todo!`,
- `unreachable!`,
- `unwrap_or` to hide failure,
- `unwrap_or_default` to hide failure.

Use typed errors or explicit result propagation.

## Allocation Discipline

When work claims zero-copy, low-copy, or low-overhead behavior:

- identify all owned buffers,
- identify all borrowed views,
- identify all MBT validation steps,
- identify all Heed-owned boundaries,
- identify all SQLite-owned boundaries,
- keep copy points explicit,
- test or measure allocation behavior when the spec requires it.

## Compile-Surface Discipline

Generated and adapter code must:

- avoid compiling unrelated schemas;
- avoid compiling descriptor/codegen dependencies into runtime users;
- avoid compiling benchmark support into production libraries;
- avoid large generated functions unless the spec proves they are required;
- measure compile impact when wide schemas are involved.
